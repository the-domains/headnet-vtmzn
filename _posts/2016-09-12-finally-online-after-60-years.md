# Finally, online after 60 years!

> It has been fun writing an application on the new electronic form, which I think works well, very well. Actually it is so far the best I have tried, and I will probably create a lot more applications.

Several phone calls to the office at Danske Filminstruktører have been similar to the following:

> That's right, I need 7 copies, and yes it's a lot. No, we can't copy it ourselves.

At the other end of the phone, a frustrated and rather stressful artist is maybe late in applying for funds for their upcoming project. That experience is a rather surprising challenge.

This process affects other things too, like the post office. Seven copies of about 100 applications have to be delivered to each of the six committee members, who have the responsibility of assessing the applications.

It is also necessary to send out emails to each applicant, as well as payments. The already busy secretary has to write a letter to every applicant, whether rejected or approved. Then the secretary has to make individual online payments to the successful applicants.

This is the process that Filmdir came to us with, a partly functioning, but slightly inefficient process. They felt it was time to digitise!

> Today is all about the potentials and pitfalls of bringing offline content into an online world.

We agreed with Filmdir that the solution had to be an ambitious launch through a module that dealt with applications, the administration and evaluations, in one place. With that solution, everyone involved would waste less time and have fewer frustrations.

We decided to create a flexible and easy-to-use cloud-based database, which was developed in Knack. We focused on the individual user and, therefore, we developed a specific interface for each group of users: applicants, administrators and committee members.

The application process is today no longer inefficient and arduous. Less time is now required, and scholarships are given to those who deserve them. The most obvious improvements are that there is less paperwork and logistics. A large number of small but time-consuming administrative tasks have been automated.

Headnet has been part of the project from the very beginning up to the finished product. We have helped by providing software developers and a technical project manager. The solution itself, as mentioned previously, was developed in Knack, and among other tasks, it required data crunching, setting up a database, and general back- and front-end development.
